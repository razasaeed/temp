        "Let’s start off with the most obvious suggestion there is – feed your child breast milk! It is recommended that a baby is exclusively breastfed during the first 6 months after birth. This is the most nutritious, easily digestible, perfectly balanced, and healthiest superfood that can build your child’s immunity for life. It also fosters the bond between mother and child. If your baby is active, looks healthy, is free of allergies, passes 4-6 stools a day, and wets 6-8 diapers, it indicates that she is getting enough breast milk. After 6 months of age, you can introduce liquids and semi-solid foods to your baby’s diet along with breast milk.",
        "This fruit is rich in potassium, Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and carbohydrates. It is also loaded with calories, making it a great food for your baby to eat to gain weight. Mash bananas or serve them in a smoothie or shake. Steamed Kerala bananas can be mashed and fed to babies for great results. It can be a part of your baby bag while travelling and makes for a convenient snack.",
        "Sweet potatoes are easy to boil and mash. They are tasty, nutritious, easy to digest, and healthy. They are also rich in Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin B6, copper, phosphorus, potassium, and manganese – the best nutrients to help kids gain weight. Sweet potatoes are also loaded with dietary fibre. You can make tasty purees and soups from this vegetable.",
        "Pulses are full of nutrients. They are rich in proteins, magnesium, calcium, iron, fibre, and potassium. After 6 months of age, you can introduce dals in the form of soup or daal paani, which is one of the most popular weight gain drinks for children.\n\nYou can also feed well-mashed khichadi. Moong daal is easily digestible and is a good option for babies. Cook pulses with rice and/or vegetables for a nutritious and fibre-rich meal.\n\nAround 7–9 months is the appropriate time to introduce your baby to some more new flavours and textures. Start feeding semi-solids, chunky, and mashed food. You can start giving your baby homemade porridge or cereals available as a ready mix in the market. For homemade cereals, you can wash daal, millets, pulses, and rice and sun-dry them. Afterwards, mildly roast the same and grind these in the mixer. Prepare multiple powders and store in labelled bottles for quick meal options. Use as and when required.",
        "Also known as finger millet or ‘nachani‘, this superfood is perfect to boost weight gain and the development of the baby. It is rich in dietary fibre, calcium, iron, proteins, and various other vitamins and minerals.\n\nIt is easily digestible and can be introduced to babies in the form of idli, dosa, porridge, malt, or cereals. Toddlers can have the same in the form of their favourite cakes, cookies, and puddings (made healthier, of course!).",
        "Ghee or clarified butter has high nutritional value. Introduce it around the 8th month of your baby’s life. A few drops of ghee can be added to porridge or sprinkled on top of mashed khichadi or daal soup.\n\nHomemade ghee from milk or malai (cream) is the best option for you if you are worried about adulteration. It is a great food to help your baby gain weight in a healthy way. Remember to use ghee in moderation as consuming it in excess can upset the baby’s tummy.",
        "It will be appropriate to add dairy products like yoghurt to your child’s diet after the age of one. Yoghurt provides fat and nutritious calories for healthy weight gain in the baby. It also improves digestion, increases immunity, and helps with gastric troubles. It can be made interesting by making yoghurt smoothies or shakes, with added chunks of fruits in it.\n\nPacked milk, butter, cheese, etc., should be introduced after 12 months of age or after taking the paediatrician’s opinion. Butter and cheese make food interesting for toddlers and add to the fat content required for healthy weight gain. Add a dollop of butter or a slice of cheese to enhance the taste of a dish served to your child.\n\nCow’s milk should be introduced to your baby only after she turns one. Ensure that you include at least 2 glasses of milk a day in your kid’s diet till she reaches her teens. Milk can be made interesting by adding dry fruits or health mixes available in various flavours in the market. Overeating or eating less of dairy products must be taken into account, as too much or too less can cause trouble for your child. In case your child has lactose intolerance or suffers from gastric problems after consuming dairy products, please consult the paediatrician.",
        "This powerhouse of protein should be introduced to your baby only after she turns one. Eggs are rich in saturated fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals; you can make several tasty dishes with them, omelettes, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, egg-rice, or French toast being a few options.\n\nCare should be taken to check for allergies and to procure good quality, disease-free farm eggs to avoid health issues. Families who prefer non-vegetarian food can introduce meat or fish to the child’s diet after consultation with the paediatrician.",
        "Almonds, pistachios, walnuts, apricots, cashews, raisins and seeds like sesame, pumpkin, flax, etc., provide kids with adequate nutrients to gain weight. They can be added to food in many interesting ways. Powder them and add to your child’s milk or sprinkle the powder on top of cereals. You can also simply give them a handful of nuts and seeds to eat.\n\nPeanut butter or almond milk are other tasty and healthy options your child will love. Almond milk especially is ideal for kids who cannot drink cow’s milk due to a dairy allergy or lactose intolerance. Dates syrup added to milk will make it an iron-rich food option for kids. It is often used as a weight gain drink.",
        "They are a rich source of Vitamin B6, E, C, K, folate, copper, dietary fibre, and pantothenic acid, and also have a high percentage of fat. Served as dips or spreads, avocados are an irresistible addition to any meal. You can even make a delicious and nutritious milkshake with avocados!",
        "Chicken is a rich source of easily digestible protein. Easily available and affordable, it helps your child build muscle mass and thus, gain healthy weight. Chicken is a versatile meal option and can be served in any form, be it in curries, as kebabs, or in salads too.",
        "Rich in natural sugars, essential vitamins, and immunity-building minerals, tropical fruits and vegetables are a must in every child’s diet chart. These include papaya, mangoes, and pineapples. Toss steamed vegetables in some butter or put together a colourful fruit salad for your child to tuck into at snack-time.",
